# Hobbes

The Hobbes is a lab FastAPI RESTFull service

## Architecture
The service is built with two components:
* FastAPI RESTFull service 
* PostgreSQL 15 

## Development
The repos uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management, building. Use the docker compose to run the service.

This will allow you to see the OpenAPI (Swagger) inter fact as http://localhost:8000/docs.
```bash
$ sudo docker compose up -d --build --remove-orphans
```

## Tests
To run the tests run the following
```bash
$ poetry run pytest
```

## Migrations
While the service will create any/all missing tables and start up, migrations are managed using Alembic. Given the service
is likely running inside a container you'll create the migrations inside and copy back out to store in the source code.
When running in different environments make sure the down_revisions match. 

To generate a migration file run the follow command and make sure to confirm the correct information is in the output.
```bash
$ poetry alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<place your revision name here e.g. add table foo>"
```

To execute the migration run the following command:
```bash
$ alembic upgrade head
```

To execute downgrade run the following command
```bash
$ alembic downgrade <revision number e.g. -1>
```
